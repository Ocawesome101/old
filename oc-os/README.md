# OC-OS

OC-OS, for ComputerCraft's CraftOS Version 1.8.

This is a semi-graphical, keyboard-navigatable, menu-based shell for CraftOS. It is my first project in Lua (which, as a matter of fact, I have known for two days as of release 0.3!). I have not found any bugs.

# Installation

To install OC-OS, simply run this command in your CraftOS terminal:

    pastebin run HK3NXe3d
    
From there, the script will guide you.

Or, if you prefer the manual way, you can `git clone` this repo and copy all of the files into your computer's folder.

Have fun!

# Known issues
