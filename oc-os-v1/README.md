# oc-os-v1
Custom OS for ComputerCraft. Precursor to the (I think) fully sandboxed v2.0.

Pretty modular.

## NOTICE
This is still highly in development! The shell works pretty well; there are just a few things to clean up, programs to write, and bugs to squash before version 1.0.

I will not provide a link to the installer until version 1.0 is released, though you can still find a very minimal one on my Pastebin account, if you can find _that_.

I do all my dev work on [CraftOS-PC 2](https://github.com/mcjack123/craftos2) by JackMacWindows/MCJack123, so any ComputerCraft incompatibilities are likely a result of this, and I would greatly appreciate it if you'd report them.

Thank you.






`MCT3UPB1` may or may not be the installer code....
