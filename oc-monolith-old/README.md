# PSA: DO NOT USE THIS

This is my first attempt at writing Monolith. It did *not* go even remotely well.

This is an unmaintainable dumpster fire. Look at the code, maybe you'll be able to tell why I rewrote it.

## Monolith

Monolith is an extremely Linux-inspired operating system for the OpenComputers Minecraft mod.
